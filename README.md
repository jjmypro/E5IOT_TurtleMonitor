# E5IOT_TurtleMonitor
This is my 5th semester Internet of Things project

You can find a short video introduction to the project here: "insert youtube link"

In short, I have build the project around the idea of creating a smarter and internet connected monitoring of our pet mud turtle and its aquarium environment.
